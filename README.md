# Overview

A JClouds BlobStore provider backed by MongoDB's GridFS.  Not all capabilities are supported, but there should be
enough for common use cases.

# Usage

First, add a dependency to your build file.  Releases are published to
[Bintray JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter).  See the [changelog](CHANGES.md) for the latest version.

Gradle:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    compile "com.commercehub.jclouds:jclouds-gridfs-blobstore:1.0.0"
}
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.commercehub.jclouds</groupId>
    <artifactId>jclouds-gridfs-blobstore</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Next, obtain an instance of the `BlobStore` using a
[standard MongoDB connection string](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/connection-string/):

```java
Properties overrides = new Properties();
overrides.setProperty(Constants.PROPERTY_ENDPOINT, "mongodb://my_mongo_server:27017/?maxPoolSize=50");
BlobStoreContext context = ContextBuilder.newBuilder("gridfs").overrides(overrides)
    .buildView(BlobStoreContext.class);
BlobStore blobStore = context.getBlobStore();
```

You can also use a non-standard connection string (deprecated):

```java
overrides.setProperty(Constants.PROPERTY_ENDPOINT, "gridfs://my_mongo_server:27017");
```

To use a replica set when using a non-standard connection string, specify additional members as a comma or
semicolon-separated list, like this:

```java
overrides.setProperty(Constants.PROPERTY_ENDPOINT, "gridfs://node1:27017;node2:27017;node3:27017");
```

Then, use the blob store to put/get blobs.  The container is in the format **DB**[/**BUCKET**], where **DB** is the
name of the database and **BUCKET** is the optional name of the GridFS bucket (which defaults to `fs`).

```java
blobStore.createContainerInLocation(null, "blobStore");
Blob blobToPut = blobStore.blobBuilder("myBlob").payload("myPayload").build();
blobStore.putBlob("blobStore", blob);
Blob blobFromGet = blobStore.getBlob("blobStore", "myBlob");
```

Finally, close the context to allow it to properly clean up.

```java
context.close();
```

# Development

## Releasing
Releases are published to [Bintray JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) via the
[gradle-release](https://github.com/townsfolk/gradle-release) plugin and
[gradle-bintray-plugin](https://github.com/bintray/gradle-bintray-plugin). To publish a new release, you need to be a
member of the [commercehub-oss Bintray organization](https://bintray.com/commercehub-oss). You need to specify your
Bintray username and API key when publishing. Your API key can be found on your
[Bintray user profile page](https://bintray.com/profile/edit). You can put your username and API key in
`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` like so:

    bintrayUserName = johndoe
    bintrayApiKey = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

Then, to publish the release:

    ./gradlew release

Alternatively, you can specify your Bintray username and API key on the command line:

    ./gradlew -PbintrayUserName=johndoe -PbintrayApiKey=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef release

The `release` task will prompt you to enter the version to be released, and will create and push a release tag
accordingly. It will also push the release artifacts to Bintray.

After publishing the release to Bintray, it's also nice to create a GitHub release. To do so:
*   Visit the project's [releases](https://github.com/commercehub-oss/jclouds-gridfs-blobstore/releases) page
*   Click the "Draft a new release" button
*   Select the tag that was created by the Gradle `release` task
*   Enter a title; typically, this should match the tag (e.g. "1.2.0")
*   Enter a description of what changed since the previous release (see the
    [changelog](https://github.com/commercehub-oss/jclouds-gridfs-blobstore/blob/master/CHANGES.md))
*   Click the "Publish release" button
